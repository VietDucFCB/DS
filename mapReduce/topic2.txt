Description: Suppose you have a large dataset containing sales transactions of a company. Each transaction includes information such as product_id, year, and revenue. Your goal is to determine the year with the highest revenue for each product.

Input Data
The data is in the following format:

product_id,year,revenue
P1,2021,15000
P2,2021,18000
P1,2022,20000
P3,2022,10000
P1,2023,17000
P2,2023,22000
...

Solution
You will use MapReduce to perform the following steps:

Map: Read each line of the data and emit a key-value pair, where the key is product_id and the value is a pair (year, revenue).

Reduce: Group the key-value pairs by product_id and find the year with the highest revenue for each product.
